        data:`Not many visiting players are given a standing ovation at the Bernabéu. Ronaldinho got one after destroying Real Madrid for Barcelona in 2006 and Andrés Iniesta’s greatness was recognised after a stunning performance at the clásico in 2015. So Mykhailo Mudryk can consider himself part of an exclusive crowd.

        It was a special moment for the Ukraine winger. He was a relative unknown at Shakhtar Donetsk when they visited the Bernabéu in November 2021, but he destroyed Dani Carvajal. It finished 2-1 to Madrid, Karim Benzema scoring twice, but that was by the by. All eyes were on Mudryk, who had the home fans on their feet when replaced with 19 minutes left.

        Those supporters must have been wondering what on earth has happened to Mudryk when Chelsea visited for the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final on Wednesday. Carvajal did not have to worry about marking him this time. Madrid did not have to worry about very much at all. It took them 22 minutes to make a mockery of Todd Boehly’s prediction – 3-0 to Chelsea – and they were not required to hit the heights to secure a comfortable 2-0 win.
        
        There had been an early flurry from Chelsea, fleeting drive from N’Golo Kanté in midfield, but Madrid quickly worked it out. Benzema opened the scoring, Ben Chilwell got sent off while trying to cover for Marc Cucurella losing Rodrygo, and Marco Asensio made it 2-0 with his first touch.
        
        Madrid cruised. It was too easy at times, and although it is tempting to wonder whether Real will regret not establishing a bigger lead, the prospect of a comeback feels slim given Chelsea have scored three times in a game on three occasions this season.
        
        Their attack is a confused, misshapen thing. They have spent a lot of money on it, only to find themselves with an array of wide players and no proven goalscorer. Is there a workable plan here? Against Madrid, Frank Lampard named Chelsea’s top scorer, Kai Havertz, on the bench. Mudryk, who arrived to great fanfare when Chelsea pipped Arsenal to him in January, was an unused substitute, along with two expensive imports from previous years, Christian Pulisic and Hakim Ziyech.`,

        title:'Jack Grealish has worked out how to be a superstar cog in a ruthless machine', 
        data:`Even as a Birmingham City fan I could not dislike Jack Grealish when he was at Aston Villa, thanks to his attacking swagger. He has taken his talent to a different level at Manchester City, but you can still see the boundless confidence that was evident from day one.

        It has taken time for Grealish to find his feet after his £100m move from his boyhood club in 2021. Last season he was regularly neither in the starting lineup nor on the scoresheet, but that has changed and he will be expected to cause problems for Leicester on Saturday. It takes time to settle into any new job and when your manager is Pep Guardiola, who has some of the most intricate tactics in the world, it is even less straightforward.

        Manchester City’s bid to complete club football and what it really means

        Few City signings hit the ground running. Raheem Sterling did not reach double figures for Premier League goals until his third season, Rodri took time to adapt to the pace of English football, and Riyad Mahrez was far from a regular early on. All three, however, can be classified as successful buys.
        
        Grealish has admitted it was a lot harder than he anticipated to learn the ways of Guardiola’s City. He had spent his whole career at Villa, coming through the academy and captaining a first team that revolved around him. The idea at Villa was to get the ball to Grealish and for him to create something. At City, he is another superstar cog in a ruthless machine. He had to work out how he fitted in and the rest of the team needed to learn his strengths and style of play.
        
        Grealish is keeping Phil Foden, a phenomenal player, out of the City and England teams, which is a strong indicator of how he is doing. He has added more goals and assists this season and is at home at City. He looks stronger and his decision-making has improved.
        
        Grealish needs that greater stamina because he has gone from Villa, where there is generally one game a week, to fighting for four trophies a season at City. But the biggest thing is that last season he was always hanging outside the box and now he is moving into better areas. I wanted him to get into the box more like Sterling would. Sterling scored his goals by becoming basically a second striker at City.
        
        There can be few bigger boosts than Guardiola picking you. Guardiola leaves big players out; he said last week that Kyle Walker did not fit the system at the moment. Walker has been one of the most influential and consistent players of the Guardiola era, but he is willing to put him on the bench. I bet Grealish goes into team meetings knowing he is going to be in the starting lineup, whereas before he would have arrived wondering. He is exuding the confidence required to thrive at the highest level.`,

        Wojciech Szczesny was substituted due to discomfort in his chest as Juventus edged to a 1-0 home win over Sporting Lisbon in the first leg of their Europa League quarter-final.
        
        The Juventus keeper was replaced by Mattia Perín just before half-time, with teammates calling to the bench for a substitution after Szczesny was seen holding his chest. The Poland international left the field in tears, but Juventus later tweeted that he was “doing well” after undergoing an initial check.`,

        title:`Luis Diaz's return is big for Jurgen Klopp - the Colombian has been the biggest loser from Liverpool's dreadful season`, 
        data:`Six months after damaging knee ligaments at Arsenal, the 26-year-old is expected to make his return to action for the Reds against Leeds on Monday

        Of all the losers from Liverpool’s quite dreadful season, Luis Diaz has been perhaps the biggest. When the Colombian went down with a knee injury at Arsenal in October, the Reds were still a team with a big reputation and lofty ambitions. Sure, they’d made a slow start to the campaign, but that was only a temporary blip, right?
        
        Once they came through it they’d be back at the top of the Premier League, and back competing for trophies, right? Right?
        
        Not quite. For as Diaz prepares to make his long-awaited, and significantly-delayed, comeback against Leeds United on Monday night, he returns to a team, a club, that is almost unrecognisable from the one he left behind in the autumn.`,
